<p>Hello, my name is Erdi. I'm from Kosovo.</p>

<p>I have a passion for programming and everything computer-related.<br>
I develop Spigot plugins over at SpigotMC.org, where I go by the username <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/members/erdi__.948543/">Erdi__</a>. I'm probably doing something Spigot-related right now</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me if you want to talk! My contact info is on the <a href='{{ "/contact" | relative_url }}'>Contact</a> page.</p>

<p>The time where I live:</p>
