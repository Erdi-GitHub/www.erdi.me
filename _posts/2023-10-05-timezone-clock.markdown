I added a timezone clock to my [about]({{ "/about" | relative_url }}) page!  
<iframe height="200px" width="100%" src="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fullscreen.html?n=743" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></iframe>
  
  
On the topic of time.. 2023 is almost over, so that's cool  
Still haven't really figured out what to do with this blog, LOL
