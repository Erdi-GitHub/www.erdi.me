# Who I Am, What I Do / My Experiences
I'm a European developer with 7+ years of experience, nearly half of that being work with Spigot plugin development. I've created a total of [14 public Spigot plugins](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/erdi__.948543/), with a few other unpublished plugins under my belt. I do anything from minigames to moderation, however I've no experience in BungeeCord development so anything like that isn't in the picture.  

# Pricing
*Payment is made via PayPal*  
  
Pricing varies by project and is negotiable, although as a general rule of thumb my pricing ranges are such:

Small projects (Simple Commands, Simple Event Manipulation, ...): <span style="color: green;">Free<span style="color: gray;">*</span> - $30</span>  
<span style="color: gray;"><i>* Small projects are free if they are simple enough and you agree to vouch</i></span>

- Revisions: 1
- Estimated delivery: 1-2 days (varying on complexity)


Standard projects (Advanced Commands, GUIs, ...): <span style="color: green;">$30 - $100</span>

- Revisions: 2
- Estimated delivery: 1-5 days (varying on complexity)


Larger projects: <span style="color: green;">$100+</span>

- Revisions: 3
- Estimated delivery: 1+ week(s) (varying on complexity)



Source code is included in all of these packages.

# Why Pick Me?
I've an extensive amount of experience in Spigot development, Java, and programming in general. I have experience in a handful of languages, such as Python, C/C++, Lua, JavaScript, and of course Java - just to name a few. I am available to also create simple scripts or applications to assist in managing your server.  
*I'm also a quick learner*, I follow instructions accurately and as well as possible. That, on top of my existing experience, means quick, accurate, and quality service!  
I am communicative. I'm open to any idea and will make sure what you get is what you want.
