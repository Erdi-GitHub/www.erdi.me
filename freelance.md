# Who I Am, What I Do / My Experiences
I'm a European developer with 7+ years of experience, nearly half of that being work with Spigot plugin development. I've created a total of [16 public Spigot plugins](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/erdi__.948543/), with a few other unpublished plugins under my belt. I do anything from minigames to moderation, however I've no experience in BungeeCord development so anything like that isn't in the picture.  

# Pricing (USD)
*Payment is made via PayPal or Ko-Fi*  
  
I'll either do $10/hr or flat-rate prices, the choice is yours on which you're most comfortable with.  
Pricing varies by project and is negotiable, although as a general rule of thumb my pricing ranges are such:

Small projects (Simple Commands, Simple Event Manipulation, ...): <span style="color: aqua;">Free</span><span style="color: gray;">*</span> <span style="color: green;"><span style="color: lightgreen;">or</span> $15 - $30</span>  

- Estimated delivery: 1-2 days (varying on complexity)


Advanced projects (Advanced Commands, GUIs, ...): <span style="color: green;">$30 - $60</span>

- Estimated delivery: 1-5 days (varying on complexity)


Larger projects: <span style="color: green;">$80+</span>

- Estimated delivery: 1+ week(s) (varying on complexity)


<span style="color: gray;"><i>* Small projects are free provided they are simple enough and you agree to vouch</i></span>

Source code is included in all of these packages. Do note, for anything $100+ I will charge 15% of the price upfront.  

# Why Pick Me?
I've an extensive amount of experience in Spigot development, Java, and programming in general. I have experience in a handful of languages, such as Python, C/C++, Lua, JavaScript, and of course Java - just to name a few. I am available to also create simple scripts or applications to assist in managing your server.  
*I'm also a quick learner*, I follow instructions accurately and as well as possible. That, on top of my existing experience, means quick, accurate, and quality service!  
I am communicative. I'm open to any idea and will make sure what you get is what you want.
