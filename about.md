Hello, my name is Erdi. I'm from the country of Kosovo.  
  
I have a passion in programming and everything computer-related.  
I develop Spigot plugins over at SpigotMC.org, where I go by the username [Erdi__](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/erdi__.948543/). I made my first plugin on November 29th, 2020.  
  
  
I am able to do freelance work, and as such - if you want a custom plugin made for your server, feel free to contact me! My contact info is on the [Contact](/contact) page, and my availability is updated [on my blog](/) and shown on the [Freelance](/freelance) page. The [Freelance](/freelance) page also contains pricing estimates and an extensive description of my experience.
